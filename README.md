# ESP32-C3 Embedded Keyword Spotting System with Quantized TFLite Model

## Overview
This project demonstrates developing a keyword-spotting system using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model deployed on an ESP32-C3 microcontroller. The CNN model was trained using Keras, quantized to TensorFlow Lite (TFLite) format, and integrated with an I2S microphone for real-time keyword recognition. The system can identify specific spoken words with an accuracy of 93%, even in resource-constrained environments.

## Features
- **Keyword Spotting**: Real-time detection of specific spoken keywords with a CNN model.
- **Model Accuracy**: Achieved 93% accuracy using a custom-trained CNN model for keyword recognition.
- **Quantized Model**: Optimized the model by converting it into TFLite format for deployment on the ESP32-C3.
- **Real-Time Inference**: The ESP32-C3 performs real-time keyword spotting by interfacing with an I2S microphone.
- **Low-Power Embedded Solution**: Designed for resource-limited environments while maintaining performance.

## Workflow
1. **Model Training**: 
    - Built and trained a CNN model using the Keras framework on a dataset of voice recordings.
    - Fine-tuned the model for better accuracy in recognizing specific keywords.
2. **Model Quantization**:
    - Quantized the trained model using TensorFlow Lite for efficient execution on the ESP32-C3â€™s limited hardware.
3. **Deployment on ESP32-C3**:
    - Deployed the TFLite model onto the ESP32-C3 System-on-Chip (SoC).
    - Integrated the I2S microphone for real-time audio input and keyword detection.
4. **Real-Time Keyword Spotting**:
    - The ESP32-C3 performs inference on the input audio data in real-time, identifying keywords based on the trained model.

## Technologies Used
- **Keras**: Used for developing and training the CNN model for keyword spotting.
- **TensorFlow Lite**: Employed for model quantization and optimizing it for embedded deployment.
- **ESP32-C3**: The target SoC for real-time keyword recognition, interfacing with an I2S microphone.
